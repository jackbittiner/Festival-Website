## Free for Arts Festival

Free for Arts Festival is an annual event in Manchester, where different people
host and organise year on year.

My friend Ruta is organising it this year and, as the festival has
never had a website before, has asked me to rustle up a quick
informative site for people to peruse!

#### What was asked of me

All that was needed was an informative webpage that gives details
about the festival as a whole. As it's for an arts festival it needs
to look and feel pretty slick and polished.
Then I was left to my own devices!

#### What I decided to do

I chose to make it a single page application, as it feels so much
smoother to navigate around the site. To do this I used Angular to
handle all of the routing, without ever refreshing or loading a new page.
The rest is simply html, css, and bootstrap! So Simple!

#### How to run?

Open up your terminal and clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:jackbittiner/Festival-Website.git
```

Then get into the root directory:

```
cd Festival-Website
```

Then run the file on a local server. I use http-server. If you have node
installed on your computer run this command to install http-server:

```
npm install http-server -g
```

(The '-g' means it will be installed globally.

Then to run to application, run the command:

```
http-server
```

#### What next?

As you can see from the webpage, it is looking a little empty and sad.
I'm currently waiting on Ruta to send over all the information and pictures
that she wants on the website.

#### Shameless Promotion for a Good Friend

Come to the festival! It's going to be great!
