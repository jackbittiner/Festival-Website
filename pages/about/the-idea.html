  Free For Arts is a unique idea of how to keep a festival in town!

FFAF has been traveling through hands of Manchester creative collectives and welcoming local audience to experience arts for free since 2009.

This year Art Vanguard has been handed over the festival baton and would like to contribute to the continuation of its legacy and create a festival FOR ALL.

This autumn, artists and creatives will inhabit 3 central Manchester spaces to provide you with a programme of original live performance, open workshops and interactive installations exploring the themes of DREAM, FANTASY and FAIRYTALE.

WE WANT TO BE ORIGINAL
pairs of artists are working to develop new collaborative performance works to be premiered at the festival.

WE WANT YOU TO CO-CREATE THIS EXPERIENCE
the creative process of collaborations will be open to public at varying stages of its development for your contribution and reflection
