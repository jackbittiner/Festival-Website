B&B is an on-going project. B&B characters were born in the summertime of 2015 in Blank canvas residency Cork town, Ireland. Two Lithuanian choreographers and performers - Greta Grineviciute and Agniete Lisickinaite created these two characters as politically active artistic figures who reflect on environment expressing their feelings, opinions and social encounters. Moreover, they are active media figures constantly questioning the need and purpose of fame and popularity. Stage performance "B and B Dialogue" were nominated for Lithuanian Golden Cross award 2017.

                                Upon premiering his work at The Banff Centre in March 2016, Joe has continued to develop his live set both technically and conceptually, culminating in solo performances, particularly within the Algorave movement and as part of Splice Festival in London. Releasing under the moniker Native, his EP 'Polaris' was released in 2016 on London based label Laura Lies In. His output is varied with stylistic themes of vocal manipulation, shimmering harmonic structures, swathes of textural ambience and deconstructed technoise. Visually, simple geometry and 3D models are abstracted real-time in a direct audio-reactive fashion creating a pseudo-synesthetic experience.
