  <p>Art Vanguard is a creative platform generating cross-disciplinary art projects.</p>
  <p>We work to provide creative people with a chance to meet and inspire unique collaborations, or even use art as a tool to raise awareness of cultural and social issues of the time.</p>
  <p>Our mission is to organise events, performances and workshops that cultivate each artistâ€˜s innate talent, help connect with other artists and encourage cooperation among different disciplines of art.</p>
  <p>Our projects have been realised in collaboration with creative partners such as Video Jam, RNCM, Slip label, Atipyka visuals, Sophro,The Whole Cow and Fringe Arts Bath. The latter included a special commission by Colloquy curator Fay Stevens for 'In Conversation' film. Art Vanguard was also featured in Curating The Contemporary (CTC) online magazine.</p>
